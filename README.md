Monkeybars "The Forge" Hackathon Github Repo
============================================

*View the [Project Page](http://forge.hartofchicago.com).* There will be more there later.

MonkeyBars is teaming up with hack@uchicago to present the best hackathon Chicago has ever seen. Yes, the best. We believe that the best products come from a focus on idea development and iteration, not business models and business plans. 

This fall, we will pay homage to this belief by inviting Chicago university students to a 28 hour ideation and rapid prototyping competition complete with hot new technology, like the Leap motion as well as hot old technology, like 3D printers and milling machines. Celebrate Chicagoâ€™s emergence as a global innovation hub by taking part in the action at IIT's Idea Shop.

What this is for?
-----------------
Normally with any Hackathon, there is some kind of code written, in this case the repo has been created beforehand.
